            Hey!!!!
            My special one!!
            Happiest Birthday to you.... bohot jaldi badi hori h yrr tu😭😭😭.
            We're at a distance now since a year and we talk less but I hope you know that I love you even more than I
            did
            when we used to meet and talk everyday and I miss you the most each day more and more..but I also knew that
            a
            time will come where we will be distant but our hearts won't ever be distant.. promise? 🤞. I just hope
            you're
            doing good in academics, career, health and every aspect of you life... Do you remember we had a dream and
            made plans that we'll both shift to another country and settle there, do our respective jobs, stay in same
            apartment together and enjoy our lives...I still remember and badly want this to happen...I wish someday
            even
            if this dream seems impossible but we will surely have a trip to somewhere... just you and me😭❤️. I know
            you
            now for almost 8 years...and I'm not letting you go away from me no matter how many arguments we have. We're
            together FOREVER.
            I LOVE YOU 😭💓
